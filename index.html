        <h2>Welcome to Hayfield Hub</h2>
        <p>Hayfield Hub: a group for those who pedal from and around Hayfield.</p>
        <p>A collective of cyclists of various disciplines centred on the weekly Wednesday night ride (mountain bikes @ 7.30 pm from the Sett Valley Trail car park) and drinks afterwards, the group has grown from just a mid-week mountain bike ride to a group that includes road, track, cyclocross, etc. and even an off-road unicyclist!</p>
        <p>If you are a local, passionate cyclist/rider/pedaller who can bring something to the group – you’re very welcome!</p>

    <!-- About us section -->
    <div id="about" style= "display: none">
        <h2>What's it all About?</h2>
        <p>We meet every Wednesday in the Sett Valley car park at 7.30 pm for the mountain bike club ride in the dark Peak District.</p>
        <p>In addition to the MTB ride on a Wednesday night, Hayfield Hub also has regular on- and off-road rides over the weekend.</p>
        <p>We have also run events; these have ranged from 1km lung-bursting hill climbs to 12-hour endurance epics - 'Mental Hillness' the Hayfield enduro.</p>
        <p>You can use the forum if you are going for a ride at any time and would enjoy some company. We have a ‘10 minute’ rule of waiting for riders who forgot their lights! Common sense really. Hayfield Hub is a non-profit organisation run by Hayfield mountain bikers. </p>
        <p>The Hayfield Hub website is run by local mountain bikers. The initial idea for this website came from cyclists who were trying to fit rides into hectic lives. The forum gives us a hub to communicate about rides (and other cycling related issues) whilst juggling other commitments. </p>
        <p>The weekly Wednesday night club rides are usually about 2-3 hours long. We meet in The Royal car park at 7.30 pm – come along and join us, you will be very welcome! Route choices are either discussed on the forum beforehand or at the start of the ride. The route choices are made with consideration of the weather, the number of riders out, and their fitness levels. The overall pace is dictated by the slowest (be that uphill or down!) with faster riders waiting for regular headcounts. If there are enough riders, there may be two groups (a faster, longer route or a shorter, slower one) depending on the requests of who’s out. </p>
        <p>These rides are social rides that always end at the pub (with many choosing to go inside to rehydrate)! </p>

        <!-- Group etiquette -->
        <h3>Hayfield Hub etiquette:</h3> 
        
        <h3>Timekeeping</h3>
        <p>We are willing to waiting a bit for riders who are running late, but we need to leave promptly as it is not fair on everyone else. So make sure you and your equipment are ready in good time.</p>
        <h3>Getting a gate – when riding off-road</h3>
        <p>The first rider to a gate 'gets the gate'; they hold it open for everyone else, counts them through, and then re-joins the group again at the back. The last rider is then their responsibility and they ride with them to the next gate or junction, where some else has 'got the gate'.  This keeps the group together and sociable.</p>
        <h3>No helmet, no ride.</h3>
        <p>What you do when you are riding on your own is your own business, but we do not want to have to scrape you off the road/trail unnecessarily! </p>
        
        <h3>It's free!</h3>
        <p>It is free to ride with Hayfield Hub; there are no joining fees or subs; and everyone (over 18*) is welcome. (*You need to be over 18 to be able to take responsibility for yourself, or ride with a supervising/responsible adult.)</p>
        
        <h3>Respect</h3>
        <p>Riders will also need to obey the rules of the Highway Code and be respectful to all riders, other people and the countryside.</p>
        
        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>Hayfield Hub is a group (not registered club), a non-profit organisation and is run only on donations with minimal costs. Therefore, Hayfield Hub has no insurance and all riders do so at their own risk. If you ride with Hayfield Hub, you take sole responsibility for yourself, your equipment and your actions. Any organisers cannot be held liable for any injury, loss or damage. You need to ride within your ability and ensure that your equipment is appropriate.</p>
        <p>We require all riders to join British Cycling, CTC/Cycling UK or equivalent to cover themselves with their insurance and take advantage of other benefits.</p>
        <p>So, come and join us for a sociable, safe, and enjoyable ride in the peak district.</p>
